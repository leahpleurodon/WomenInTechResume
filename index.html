    <p>
      Hello there,
      <br />
      Welcome to my application website (and subsequent cover letter.)
      I have made my intention to become a developer clear in the past 2 years I have worked at REA group.
      In the following questions that were posed to us in the expressions of interest I hope to address the reasons why
      I think I am an excellent candidate for this program.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p><li><strong>Why are you interested?</strong></li>
        A few reasons, I know I want to be a developer, I also want to mentor women in tech, I feel like if I’m successful in my own goals within tech I will be better equipped to do so.</p>
      <p><li><strong>What have you done to date in support of this career goal?</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Applied for scholarships</li>
          <li>Worked with both a general mentor and code mentor</li>
          <li>Studied Udemy courses</li>
          <li>Attended rails girls/ devops girls</li>
          <li>Mentored at rails girls/devops girls</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><li><strong>Where do you see your developmental gaps?</strong></li>
        I lack real life experience when it comes to development. I understand the basic principals of code but not how to use them in an large scale environment. Also my design and object oriented programming still needs some work.</p>
        <p><li><strong>What is your long term plan? i.e. which role in the business?</strong></li>
        Long term I’d love to be senior developer, even a lead dev.</p>
        <p><li><strong>Is this already in your REA career plan?</strong></li>
        Yes, I have been working on this for some time and all people managers in my team are aware and supportive of this.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>Taking all this into consideration and the fact that I have been working on this goal since before the inception of this program
      I think I will be a great candidate in regards to my own success and also in regards to the return on investment for REA as I am keen
      to continue my work in aid of women in tech throughout my entire career.</p>
      Regards,
      <br />
      Leah

      <h2>My Story of Interest - The Kmart Vaccuum - Price & Prejudice</h2>
      <div class="modal-content">
          <p style="font-style: italic;">It is a truth universally accepted that a single person in their mid 20s, in possession of a rental
          apartment must be in want of items from Kmart.</p>
          <p>On a sunny day one such woman was browsing a click-bait link on facebook when she came across
          an article pertaining to a vaccuum which could be purchased at Kmart.
          This in itself is not strange, Leah had seen many vaccums in Kmart that appeared to be contructed of lego,
          however the article had made the claim that this vaccuum was to rival a Dyson, even a Kirby!</p>
          <p>Leah had recently heard that Kirbys were invented by N.A.S.A, so for a vaccuum cleaner worth $89 to
          even be compared to one, let alone favourably... Leah had to have one.</p>
          <p>Weeks had passed and it seemed that other's had heard of the news of the fabled vaccuum, no matter how many times Leah called
          no Kmart seemed to be in stock of this Excalibur of vaccuums... Her co-workers who once had, had a sympathetic ear to Leah's
          woes had now become rather tired of hearing about vaccuums (and to be frank, a little concerned at Leah's obsession with a cleaning appliance.)</p>
          <p>Leah tried to rationalize giving up on the vaccuum, she had been fooled previously by the "H2O steam mop" it was supposed to be able to remove stains
          from all kinds of floors, to this day Leah maintains the only thing it has been successful in removing is her faith in humanity.</p>
          <p>Still Leah powered on with her enquires to Kmart until one day she received a mysterious text from someone who had found the vaccuum available at a remote Kmart.
          Leah was so excited to see she was to be in possession of the vaccuum that she forgot to ask the person who they were. The mysterious stranger had promised to
          bring the vaccuum into work the next day. One thing was for sure, the mysterious stranger was a colleague.</p>
          <p>Leah looked around the office the next day for a sign of the vaccuum, it was not to be found. Feeling a bit dishevelled and curious as to the identity of the
          mysterious stranger she began to search for clues. There was no trace of the mobile number in any of REA's directories and she'd received no previous messages
          from the number, the only clue she had was that the stranger had taken a picture of the vaccuum, which included a picture of their keys with a "Tile" keychain.</p>
          <p>Rather anticlimactially (perhaps this is the wrong term, one doesn't typically expect a story about a vaccuum to have a plot twist,) Leah never did come to a conclusion during her investigation, luckily Amanda
          walked into the office at 11pm carrying one Kmart vaccuum, Leah had finally
          gotten her mits on the bloody appliance (and solved the burning riddle that was plagueing her for the past half an hour.)</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">While not a particularly interesting story for most, this consumed the better part of 3 months of Leah's life. This is an absolutely true
          story with no embellishment, and before you ask, yes Leah actually bought a H20 mop... yes, she will regret it to her dying day, in her defence, she just really enjoys watching infomercials.
          </p>
          <h3>TL;DR</h3>
          Leah is a little obsessed with vaccuums, and finally obtained one... she is now in the process of obtaining a life.
